# a summary about you
summary: "I am a passionate software & data engineer devoted to doing projects that advance the public good. I pick up new tech stacks quickly and enjoy building things from scratch, but I also get a pecuiliar sort of enjoyment out of navigating legacy code. Before I transitioned into software engineering, I spent 4+ years in data science consulting, so I'm just as comfortable talking to non-technical clients and leadership as I am getting into the weeds with fellow developers. I love mentoring other developers and sharing knowlege."
